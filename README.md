# Document-distance-
An application for the winning algorithm I designed for the Fastest Algorithm Competition. I got 13th place out of 500+ candidates.
this application computes the angular distance between two documents(two vectors).
Originally the output was only the angular distance, I modified it to also calculate the similarity(plagiarism) along with basic information about the two documents like no. of words and letters, and finally print the execution time.
I applied all that in a windows forms application with easy user friendly use with a modern UI Design.
this application Can Print a file of the plagiarism results ( plagiarism report)
finally, you will find.exe file to directly open and use the applicatio

technology used: C# - Windows Forms.
